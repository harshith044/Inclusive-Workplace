Challenge:
People often face extra steps: checking availability, confirming features, navigating complex booking tools.
Even without accessibility needs, employees still lose time and focus dealing with clunky search and booking systems.
Most current tools expect the user to adapt to the system, not the other way around.
This creates frustration, reduces productivity, and in some cases, limits equal access to the workplace.
